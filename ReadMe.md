## Good Times

## Description

It is a lifestyle blog that showcases school related tasks and tips, 
leisure acrivities to do during free time, and travel content that shows
beautiful destinations here in the Philippines. 

> Process on Creating the Website
On the UI, we created a mood board that will spark inspirations,
and wpuld serve as a guidance for our design journey

On the coding part, we created HTML first then made it into PHP later on
as PHP has features that makes our coding process easier. We also used SCSS
instead of just CSS because it allows nesting, which makes the code look
neater and more readable. 

We also have .font folder aside from the font folder because Heroku 
wont deploy the font unless it is stored in a .font named folder.
