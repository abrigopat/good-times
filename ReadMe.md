> Process on Creating the Website <br><br>

On the UI, we created a mood board that will spark inspirations,<br>
and wpuld serve as a guidance for our design journey<br><br>

On the coding part, we created HTML first then made it into PHP later on<br>
as PHP has features that makes our coding process easier. We also used SCSS<br>
instead of just CSS because it allows nesting, which makes the code look<br>
neater and more readable. <br><br>

We also have .font folder aside from the font folder because Heroku <br>
wont deploy the font unless it is stored in a .font named folder. <br><br>
